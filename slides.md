## What is CodeRefinery

[RB drafts this, 5 minutes]

- What is CodeRefinery?
- How does it relate to Carpentries?
- Lightning slide-deck (3 slides, link to web)
- Audience: our audience is not mostly pure beginners
- Ask Question via HackMD:
  - Is there a need for more intermediate/advanced Carpentries-style
    material for learners who have completed a basic Carpentries
    training?
  - What topics/courses are needed?

## A vision of reaching many people at once

[RD drafts this, 2+10+3 minutes]

- What was a Mega-Workshop? and why?
- Why you would want to - the promise of technology reaching everyone.
- Why you need a vision (Mega-Coderefinery vs HPC kickstart)
- You can get even *more* out of it
- Question to audience via breakout room, answers in HackMD:
  - How can large be more inclusive?  How is it less?
  - What technical obstacles does it have?
- Do we discuss results in main room?

## "lecture and exercises"

[not sure this is the right name, it's not quite "filpped classroom", what is it?]

[AF drafts this, 2 minutes]

- short lectures and "asynchronous Q&A" in main room
- exercises more in the breakout rooms among groups

---

## Collaborative notes

- Use of HackMD for collection of Q&A regarding lesson contents

  - '+' It keeps record of Q&A so that it is possible to review afterwards.
  - '+' Main flow is not disrupted.
  - '+' Stable most of the time with 50-100 users (depending on the edit history length).

- For short communications for more practical questions, we used Zoom chat function.

<!--   what the other roles are, so that you can focus on what makes your role -->
<!--   special -->
<!--     - one slide per role -->
<!--     - Naoe starts this session by giving word to the speakers -->

[RB drafts this, 5-10 minutes]

<!-- 1-2 slides but q&a and "discussion" via hackmd -->

- Continue with online workshops even later - this is not "replacement to
  in-person" but much better in some ways
- Does this work in all audience types? Diversity, tech background.
- Encourage and accept lurkers more (better experience when streaming).
- How can we make a federated model via the stream? We don't know yet.
